This branch supports cmake Makefile auto-generation.

USAGE:
1. clone the repository.
2. create a build directory, preferably outside the source directory
3. run: cmake <location of the top-level of the source directory>
4. run: ccmake <location of the top-level of the source directory>
5. select the packets needed, (not all switches have been implemented)
6. press c to configure cmake scipts

This branch has been configured to work with VSCode gdb debug tool and cross-references.
1. from the root of the source directory, run vcode .
2. to do debug and launch.

RASPBERRY PI 
in order to add ncurses support, the library will have to be cross-compiled for ARM. For this, clone the fit repo of ncurses and
git clone https://github.com/gittup/ncurses 
CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc ./configure --host=arm-linux --with-shared  --with-build-cppflags=-D_GNU_SOURCE --prefix=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/
make HOSTCC=gcc CXX=arm-linux-c++ -j12

usage: change step 3 to cmake $(TOP) -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$(TOP)/toolchain-rasp2b.cmake


CROSS-COMPILE for 32-bit OS
In order to crosscompile for 32-bit Linux Os, install lib gcc-multilib, g++-multilib, libncurses5-dev:i386, libncurses5:i386, libstdc++-7-dev-i386.
cmake $(TOP) -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$(TOP)/toolchain-m32.cmake
